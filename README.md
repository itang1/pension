## Overview
This Streamlit application is an interactive financial modeling tool designed to allow users to adjust variables such as salary growth, expected investment returns, and number of years spent in retirement. It offers a data-driven comparison between the long-term value of a pension vs. a hypothetical self-managed investment strategy. The goal of this calculator is to support evidence-based dialogue so that individuals can form fact-based opinions and make informed decisions rather than rely on emotional arguments or misinformation.

## Features

- A narrative conclusion to help interpret the results
